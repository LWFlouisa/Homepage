PART SAMANTHA


PAGE ONE ( 5 Panels )

Panel 1. Packaged Ramen noodles is resting in the cabinet. The cabinet is as dark as a cave. A little bit of light shows through, hinting at a light in the kitchenette.

Caption: Ramen is on the shelf, it waits
To be slow cooked.

Caption: On the shelf, it waits
To be simmered in the pan,

Caption: Simmering in the pan.

Panel 2. It is a two bedroom apartment. The mother takes out the Ramen noodles from the shelf.

Panel 3. SAMANTHA and JKOVO are sitting at the dinner table. The mother is dolling out food. The father is reading the newspaper. The headline on the newspaper eludes to the Northern alliance winning territory over the Southern alliance.

SAMANTHA: Meatballs again mom?
MOM: As it always will be, as the war lasts.

Panel 4. Soldiers on the battle front are being dished Ramen noodles on the battle front. The military cafeteria’s only light is that of the bombs going off on the battle field.

Caption: The rations of the war lifts
Heavy young spirits.
On the hot pan it lifts,

Caption: And tosses and turns on eye,
Simmering on eye.

Panel 5. JKOVO is slinging his past in SAMANTHA’S direction. The father briskly restrains JKOVO’s arm.

JKOVO: Don’t play with your food Sammy.
SAMANTHA: How about not fling Spaghetti at me.
FATHER: If you keep slinging those, that’s all you’ll ever eat.


PAGE TWO ( 4 Panels )

Panel 1. The father and mother are arguing about whether to talk about the news at the dinner table. JKOVO has finally stopped slinging his Ramen noodles at Samantha.

FATHER: Did you hear about this one guy that--
MOTHER: Can it Harold, that will gross out Samantha. She barely eats now.
FARTHER: This is important news going on.
MOTHER: I would rather mow all the grass in the lawn.

Panel 2. SAMANTHA, JKOVO, and their parents pack their bags to move to the Northern Union in order to evade the electro-magnetic bombs being dropped. The bedroom is empty, with visual elements of JKOVO’s childhood memories having imprints that remain.

JKOVO: I don’t want to move.
SAMANTHA: We don’t have a choice bro.

Panel 3. All of them are riding down the road in a hurried motion, while flying wing jets are dropping bombs. Crowds of people are developing infections in the impact zone of the blasts.

SAMANTHA: All my childhood friends...
JKOVO: At least with have Ramen.

Panel 4. We cut to a snapshot of the interaction of them in a car. The interaction is slapped with a Ramen noodle brand promotion.

BANNER: Brought to you by Ramen Sensei.
BANNER: The best food rations you will ever eat in the apocalypse.

SAMANTHA and JKOVO: Shut up Ramen Sensei!

Panel 2. MOM wakes up SAMANTHA abruptly.

SAMANTHA: Mio nio vichi yonei pierui.
MOM: I just don’t want you to have problems.
SAMANTHA: Everything will be fine!

Panel 3. The whole family parks in the parking lot of their new home. A more advanced version of a trailer park, while parked spaceships have landed on the transformed desert made to be more livable for humans.

FATHER: We’re home.
JKOVO: This is very different...
SAMANTHA: From what I’m used to.
MOTHER: We’ll get used to it.
