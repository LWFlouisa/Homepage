<h2 id="myunresolvedfeelingsaboutculture">My Unresolved Feelings About Culture</h2>

<p>This will be about my unresolved feelings about French culture. As a background, I had considered myself having certain interests. I suppose you could say fetishes, although that might be to strong of a word. What I will say is despite this fetish, I also paradoxically grew to absolutely disdain French culture, or at least the way that I had perceived it at the time. Now I can’t even talk to a therapist without worrying about cancel culture. I would say my defining Graphic Novel, extremely personal to me, is quite literally me working through my issues about my feelings about French culture on my own.</p>

<p>I don’t even feel comfortable even calling it a Leftist Graphic Novel, although if you asked any people of a certain ilk in comics, anything that is simply about making people’s lives slightly better, is apparently what an SJW is. It was my only chance to actually resolve some personal issues I had with French culture at the time. Because I truly do not expect the left to actually be able to handle such issues in a responsible manner.</p>

<p>It all started when I met this one girl back in fifth grade: apparently the way she would communicate her attraction was by saying shit like “You’re ugly, but French people like ugly people, and I’m French-American.” I suppose it might be more accurate to say that I had issues with French-Americans. Something about moving to the US before the 21st century, and keeping the old values that French had long sense moved past. But around the same time, I was still writing on WTPD where the entire thing of that place was to allow French-Speakers to completely and thoroughly colonize their forums.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, it wasn’t even really possible to even ask for a translation, so I basically had no other choice but to learn French, despite not otherwise having this in mind. This was despite the fact that WTPD was suppose to an English-language forum. If it were the US, this would be one thing, as the US has always been a melting pot. But on a forum where the expectation that you write in English, the French seemed almost the sole exception, until other languages started showing.</p>

<p>So I resisted the idea, as long as I wrote on WTPD, that I would absolutely never learn French. It made me wonder why it was actually that the French had instruments like the guillotine, something that was originally designed as an instrument of mercy, that ended up becoming just another part of colonialism. I imagine people in places attacked by the US, that feel the same way about people that speak the English language. But this graphic novel is based on actual emotional issues that I’ve had. I don’t want the Leftists feeling like they can just push more to be more and more “revolutionary”.</p>

<p>I just want to be decent to other human beings, French or not. Even if I gradually wanted to see that culture bleed. Originally, why I wanted to create this conlang, was not having to worry about constant corrections about my bad ability to speak and write in French. I would much rather just have people not understand what I’m even saying at all, and say what’s on my mind. Seriously, Leftists, you had so much promise. Why are you worshiping the 19th century French?</p>

  
<h2 id="realismisnoendallbeall">Realism Is No End All Be All</h2>
  
<p>This essay will be about the uncanny valley effect, and why I have never previously liked Western comics in the past. Much this comes from a similar reason why I dislike increasingly realistic 3D modeling in game design, and how it has even ruined JRPGs I otherwise loved: in a sense, unlike Manga, American comics ( and multi-media more generally ) suffers from the uncanny valley effect. One thing slightly off that is unrealistic, and it ruins the entire illusion that American comics has created.</p>

<p>This is why things like Thor smashing things with his hammer, and Superman with his indestructible body and eye lasers I found so jarring: it has established itself to be the “superior” art form, despite the fact that one wrong thing can ruin the image. By contrast, Manga focuses so much on expressiveness and less on realism, that it doesn’t suffer this problem: because they never pretended to be realistic, there isn’t issues like the eyeballs rolling in the incorrect direction, and other things that ruin the illusion: specifically, that Illusion was never created to begin with.</p>

<p>Even in more realistic Manga, like Ikigami and Eternal Sabbath, there is still enough non realism--the “sketchy” look--that an eyeball slightly misaligned is not going to ruin the entire image. Although these just begin to go into what I consider “uncanny effect” for American comics.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Western Comics are largely to blame for having to much realism on their comics, so that if one thing looks slightly off, then the rest of the image looks like crap. Comic Strips also generally do not suffer from this specific problem.</p>

<p>The final issue that such overdoses on realism tends to cause, is that it creates the wrong general impression what is considered good for “entry” level manga creation, and makes people work to something that is generally impossible for beginning artists. It encourages short cuts in the creation process, like tracing Notre Dame, because they have to reach a certain “realism” quota that is simply unattainable for beginning artists. Even the people I’ve seen touting realism, generally will inconsistently apply this expectation: such as giving a pass to “male created” comics that have been grandfathered into the industry.</p>

<p>Mostly the expectation of “realism” is mainly used to harass women and other minorities creators out of the comic creation business, simply because their artistic standards isn’t necessarily the same as what is established in the Big Two in comics. They are even condescending to people who use water colors and ink washes, despite Sumi Painting being an established art form. There are even genres in fine art that play with “realism” for uncanny effects, such as by route of Magical Realism and Surrealism. There is also Cubism and Expressionism as well.</p>

<p>Realism is only one possible way to draw images, but it is far from the definitive way to draw graphic novels.</p>


<h3 id="whileimnottotallyovermanga">While I'm Not Totally Over Manga</h3>
  
<p>I wouldn’t say I’m completely over manga per say, there is still a lot of good manga that is still coming out. But the analogy I would use is someone who buys you a new meal if someone else steals one of your meals. Sure it’s fantastic you get to eat, but what you really want is that other person to stop stealing your food, so your friend doesn’t have to keep buying you new food. In a way, I’ve begun to see manga as that kind soul that keeps buying you new food, but doesn’t really stop the other person from stealing your food. In a sense, whatever way that Manga is counter-cultural, it doesn’t really fix the issues that are present in American comics.</p>

<p>At most what you might be able to say, is Manga distracts you from the issues that are apparent in American comics. But we still have a generation of people that prefers this distraction, rather than fixing the problems that attracted people like US to manga to begin with: it was a break from the environment of being talked down to as children, even though content was supposedly adult fiction. Things would be cut to off screen, despite the target audience being over the age of eighteen. I feel like Manga distracts from the issue. But there are aspects of manga ( particularly Seinin and Josie ) that I prefer over American comics here. But to me the problem isn’t necessarily to keep sending more manga, but to offer what is good about Manga in American comix: it’s able to address social issues in a way that doesn’t just further cement power in the establishment.</p>

<p>Gives American comics the tools to actually be relevant as a an additional “common language”. As it is, American comics are so stuck in the tradition of that particular industry, that they are rapidly losing relevance to people that prefer better comics that manga seems to provide: they prefer people keep buying them new sandwiches, rather than ask the person to stop stealing their food. I feel like Manga has contributed to this environment where Americans cannot even be satisfied with aspects that make American comics unique, or maintain the toxic things of the past that aren’t so much unique as annoying and unnecessary. Or excessively frivolous like super hero content. Manga took advantage of American consumers getting tired of the shit they were being offered in the US, rather than encouraging us to produce equally good content.</p>

<p>This especially effected a certain generation of consumers, between the years 2004-2007, where now books feel genuinely weird because they read left to right: in a sense we prefer reading in the direction of our economic colonizers. The Manga colonization of American comics is almost complete. What I somewhat wish is that rather than manga continuously waving false promises about Manga being a universal language, to actually help Americans produce good content here. Or at least, help Americans integrate into Japan, for those of us who don’t even relate to our own country anymore, do to the political issues that are going on here among extreme factions.</p>

<p>Manga should encourage American comic companies to stop stealing the limelight from Americans that want to actually produce something unique, that has as much relevance in American society, as Alternative Manga does in Japan, and how it came to influence and change the Manga industry. Also none of this American first sentiment, where Americans are saying Japanese people wont read our stuff. I want Japanese people to be proud to read unique American content, as a separate thing from manga. And treated as an equal contender in the marketplace of ideas, rather than relegated as second class citizens. Rather than Manga, Comics itself should be a universal language.</p>

<p>Because all sequential art is comics / manga.</p>
  

<h3 id="ontechniqueincomix">On Technique In Comix</h3>
<p>Particularly in alternative comix, a lot of the time the focus is on the specific technique, though I don’t find a lot of videos about the technique of drawing individual panels: specifically, when you’re painting calligraphy you generally wash on the entire sheet, rather than just inside of a specific panel. Because pure calligraphy is not generally split into panels. Often this means having to scan the entire sheet just to do one panel. For standard paper size, this isn’t such a big deal, but it is a problem when one of your sheets is about the size of two comic book pages put together. This is making me reconsider how I draw panels to begin with.</p>

<p>I propose a system of “hardware panels”, that is, the sheet in question is specifically folded into several panels, and then each portion of the image is scanned individually. Parts of this image are then molded into the shape of one panel in a 4-panel grid. My understanding in manga is that this is generally called aspect-by-aspect transition, however I’m not sure if they’re specifically referring to traditional calligraphy. This means modifying my entire approach to Sumi Painting, so that I’m able to fit everything all into what I have in mind. I originally planned on a four panel grid to act sort of like what they call “constrained prose / poetry” in the writing world: there is an aspect applied onto you that limits how you draw the story in question.</p>

<p>Therefore the next few pages, I’m thinking of just doing experimental art where I try different page fold size to get the right Hardware Panel form. Note however these will only be for sections where I use the constructed language to letter my graphic novel, and not necessarily for the portions where I use English or French.</p>

<p>I probably end up sticking with regular paneling for when I traditionally draw the normal parts of the graphic novel. In fact I’ve been thinking for now to focus Sumi Painting on flashback sequences for the time being.</p>

<p>Perhaps eventually I may get to the point where I can apply that technique through out the piece, and for my shorter novelettes I really don’t think that will pose as much of a problem.</p>
  

<h3 id="impossibletobeseenasanormaltranswoman">It's Impossible To Be Seen As A Normal Trans Woman</h3>
<p>Trans women and men are normal people, like every other men and women. We are not inventing new gender pronouns to prove our oppression status. I feel honestly betrayed by trans support groups, because what I associate with them now is the larger LGBT mythology invented out of whole cloth, by ideological extremists, that do not represent the best interests of trans people.</p>

<p>My lifelong goal had been to become a science fiction and fantasy writer, and to produce graphic novels. If my main character was transgendered, this meant pretty much what being transgendered has always meant: it means going to see a gender therapist, taking hormones for a certain period of time, and then having the necessary surgeries to complete your transition. But it has come to be used in ways that don’t even represent trans issues.</p>

<p>Just because I am a trans woman, does not mean that every time I create a trans character I want to depict them as having a persecution complex, and inventing new pronouns to satisfy this narcissistic tendency. You have the extreme left that are literally making us look like nothing else, and not being held accountable for this behavior.</p>

<p>You have Right-Wingers, that take this narrative and completely run with it, by constantly rebranding their own channels to fit within different narratives to perpetuate a culture war with the left. But an extremely important thing seems to be lost in this discussion: neither side represents the best interest of trans men and women.</p>

<p>Trans women / men, in almost all cases, simply want to be left alone to live their lives. Not be forced into different political ideologies, especially authoritarian ones. And now, with Anarcho-Communism becoming increasingly an oxymoron at this point, you have places like Chaz / Chop literally taking us along for that specific joy ride. A ride where you have absolute nut jobs thinking it’s OK to lecture people about mask wearing, while literally exposing yourself in public to fulfill some kind of oppression quota.</p>

<p>I don’t think that most trans support groups tolerate such political extremism, but I honestly have no idea. But there should be a new rule in trans support groups: this is not a group for preaching a political ideology, whether that is trans medicalism or trans abolitionism. Lesbians that want to debunk trans issues? Doesn’t belong in a trans support group. Lesbians who aren’t trans should not be leading any trans support group. Anarcho-communists that want to dismantle the system? Again, has no place in a trans support group.</p>

<p>The transgendered community needs to start enforcing these boundaries, as we have literally non trans people driving the public narrative about trans issues, and making it impossible to be seen as a normal Scifi and Fantasy writer, despite being a trans woman.</p>

<p>If it were a normal situation, we would be talking about how trans people can still get the medicine that we need, despite there being a pandemic. But that'ts not even being discussed, because anarchists have attempt to discredit medical science.</p>


<h3 id="theesiomimanifesto">The Esiomi Manifesto</h3>
  
<p>Is Manga a universal storytelling medium? If I am to believe the word of Silent Manga Audition, then perhaps. With all do credit, I certainly believe it’s a step above the format found in American comics, that offer overpriced sequential art on crowdfunding platforms, charging you 32 dollars for for 28 pages. Sure, while American comics may not be charging that much, the standard rate of comic books is well above the rate of inflation. At least with manga, because it is printed in black and white, it is more accessible. However there are several roadblocks that keep Manga from being even more accessible: primarily this is the barrier to entry to Shounen Jump. While it is true you can publish is various genres other than superhero content, there is an artificial barrier based on account of not being Japanese.</p>

<p>Where does this put someone who doesn’t neatly fit in a category between Western Comics and Japanese Manga? They draw in a more painterly kind of style, but still prefer to publish their work in Japanese, and publish in a language that isn’t quite French or Nihongo? I created this constructed language to account for the fact that in every single instance when I’ve tried learning a language, there is always that one person that looks down on people that don’t speak or write perfectly in that language. The solution here is obvious, because the way that you speak and write is a lot of the Japanese criteria for why someone is accepted into manga magazines, that would otherwise be a step above what is currently being published in the states.</p>

<p>This is why it is my intention to leave Western Comics and Japanese manga in my dust; I no longer feel like I need to published as a manga creator to feel as if my work has validation; my intention to create an entirely separate medium distinct from comics or manga, but still in the realm of sequential art, that has something closer to my own sensibility. This sensibility will be similar to the comic strip / yonkoma format, but with a few modification that make it more easily usable for my constructed language. This constructed language will utilize the grammar of the French language, and the vocabulary of Japanese. It will use its own distinct writing system that can be thought of as a paired down version of the Japanese language.</p>

<p>Most importantly, because it is a language that I have created, Japanese and French people have no excuse for looking down on me for not speaking their tongue in a perfect manner. I will make it easy as humanly possible to learn this distinct language.</p>

<p>I suppose you could call this a Secessionist Movement separate from corporate Manga as an institution; it will use the design sensibilities of art books in how it makes its cover art, but with the interior pages that flow more like Comic Strip Plus format, here defined as: a series of four or less panels that is drawn in a surrealistic and magical realistic fashion, that uses unconventional drawing media, such as blood, charcoal, Sumi painting, and acrylic inks. This will be told in my constructed language using a syllabic, rhyme, and metrical system distinct for this medium.</p>

<p>Most importantly, the captions will be transparent. I will primarily use black and white color, similar to manga. However the intent will be to use colors on important objects, and therefore to keep this color will be printed on higher quality paper, rather than Newsprint. Initially I may do these on Bristol board, however I may eventually find something that has characteristics of Rice Paper and Bristol Board. These will be “done in one” in 120-300 pages, rather than in a series of self-contained 22-24 page stories. More to the point, these will use poetry forms as narration.</p>

<p>See you when Uploaded Fairy is released, either on Itch ( if I decide to keep using it ), or self-published in my own studio.</p>
  

<h3 id="epirusediiesiomo">Catagories Of "Light Novels"</h3>
  
<p>There are four sets of "Light Novels" for the Hafestran language:</p>

<p>Epiruse Dii Esiomu - These light novels are generally targeted at older teenagers and young men. The plots generally revolving around the "main action" in Post Apocalyptic narratives, rather than relationships that happen behind the scenes. In general, I plan on focusing less on Esiomu type narratives.</p>

<p>Epiruse Dii Esioma - These light novels are generally targeted at older teenagers to young women, and revolve around the romantic relationships in apocalyptic scenarios. My approach with Esiomi will primarily focus on these sorts of plot lines, with occassional dips into Epiruse Dii Esiomu.</p>

<p>Epiruse Dii Esiomo - These are two cross gender Post Apocalyptic books, that focus on every aspect of the Post Apocalyptic world of French and Japanese speaking portions of the United States. I consider my first Light Novel to be Epiruse Dii Esiomo. Within its own continuity, Epiruse Dii Esiomo can lean toward Esiomu or Esioma.</p>

<p>Eventually I will be switching to using these catagories when marketing my work, making the system I use distinct from the catagories used in Manga Magazines, along with using a picto-syllabic language that is left to right, even though these will still be drawn right to left in graphic novel form.</p>


<h3 id="musicchanges">Music Taste Changes As You Get Older</h3>
<p>Music is one of those things that tends to change as you become older: initially I burnt myself on country music, and this was before I realize that it had a conservative political slant ( conservative in a before 2016 sense ). So I had avoided anything folksy of all kinds mostly because what I tended to associate with folk music was bad southern accents, and people whining about shit I didn’t care about.</p>

<p>Yet now as I get older, I’m increasingly growing a preference for some forms of traditional music, although it should be noted that this tends to be music not in the English language. I tend to associate English with crudeness, and in some cases doesn’t use music to the best of its abilities. In general, I prefer the sound of such music in languages like French and Portuguese, do to the fact that languages other than English ( and maybe Germanic languages as well ) tend to be syllabic timed.</p>

<p>Probably my favorite Portuguese music artist is Roberto Leal, although that may just be because I don’t understand the Portuguese language real well, but there certainly isn’t a Southern American accent. And there is nothing worse than a Southern conservative. But the melody itself is extremely addicting. I had even eluded to my parents how if you took away the lyrics in country, it would almost be tolerable.</p>

<p>Simply put, to me English to me sounds like grunting. It’s the language that cavemen speak when they don’t have a more polite way of communicating their message. Even French sometimes sounds comparatively crude compared to the Portuguese language, although in every day parlance it does sound exactly as French tend to be stereotyped: sexy, witty, partying. It’s a language of some beautiful woman going down on you.</p>

<p>These days I have largely gotten over my issues with French people, after learning their language. But I still don’t care for country music specifically. But I absolutely love certain kinds of traditional music, in syllabic timed rhythm, with some dances.</p>
  

<h3 id="inanimesequence">In Anime Sequence</h3>
<p>This essay is about the building resentment I’ve been having toward manga, that has been slowly building every sense Tokyopop and Ink Blazers gave me the wrong impression of how easy it is to get into the Manga industry in Japan. I feel like I spent a lot of years as a novelist, visualizing the scenes that I would write in anime sequences in my head, under this idea that maybe someday I could be published in Shounen Jump, and eventually Young Jump. Although now the own quality manga scenes these days seem to be Josie magazines. At least for now such magazines have not be effected by American politics, but the barrier to entry is still even worse than in Silent Manga Audition.</p>

<p>Manga could have branded itself right off the bat as this thing where now Gaijin could possibly ever have any real hope of being published in any of their books, and perhaps I wouldn’t have gravitated to Manga quite as much as I did. To think that at one point I had considered Manga as a panacea to the problems that seemed inherent in American animation and comics. While it’s certainly true that this would not be noticed by people that only read manga, it sticks out like a sour thumb that want to create it. And now I almost feel ready to completely repudiate both American and Japanese comics. And perhaps even French comics, if the barrier to entry is even worse.</p>

<p>We need a system in place where we don’t really need American, French, and Japanese comic publishers to feel validated as sequential art creators, even if that means operating on largely an individual basis that is most conducive for branding ourselves as LGBT persons. I genuinely don’t see real reforms actually happening in either American, French, or Japanese comics. Especially for LGBT people who have not bought into Critical Theories, or believe that gender is a social construct. It doesn’t help that Comicsgate highlights the general right-wing slant that seems inherent in American comics.</p>

<p>Ink Blazers could have been a great thing, at least for the length of time that I didn’t know how to make my own website. But now publishing my writing on Wattpad, and trying out places like Tapas out seems largely like a waste of time to me. Because the real issue is not completely throwing the baby out with the bath water when it comes to who gets to be published, but route of websites like Pixiv, with website bugs that take longer than they should to be fixed. But by having an actual viable editorial standards that is inclusive in LGBT in the right way, and not through the lens of Critical Theory. And also inclusive of Gaijins that wants to learn Japanese, and have equal access to the publishing world as anyone native to that country.</p>

<p>If this issue were fixed, I would already move. As the United States is absolutely dead to me as a Leftist that simply wants to go Deep Stealth with her gender transition. And also blend in with Japanese natives, and could learn the language to relative proficiency. In a sense though, no matter what I do, I will always be seen as “that fake mangaka” because my native language is not Japanese. So I’m stuck in a state where I have no patriotism to American Comics, and would rather go my own way from Manga.</p>

<p>I no longer dream in anime sequence.</p>
  

<h3 id="esoupediiemiro">Esoupe Dii Emiro: A Sub-Set Of Ero-Guro</h3>
<p>Traditionally ero-guro is meant to have a weird sense of eroticness, and a grotesque element. However much of mine is going in a slightly different direction from the genres roots: in general, mine tends to focus on romantic couples. The focus is primarily on the grotesque aspect, and less so on the erotic aspect. To this extent, Esoupe Dii Emiro is more horror-oriented despite having its origins in gothic romance to some degree. That's not to say romantic elements wont be present. For specifics:</p>

<p>Esoupe Dii Emiro is derived from Couple and the word for death in French. Themes often revolve around "Reve De Repos" or dreams of death, and less so on actual deaths that happen as the story progresses. Generally such dreams revolve around time travel, and perilous situations that threaten the metaphysical demise of the main character, but also some dreams can also bleed into the real world, such as in the second of my book Uploaded Fairy.</p>

<p>In specifics, rather than a romance slowly being established, Esoupe Dii Emiro establishes a relationship from the get go, and the romantic pairing slowly breaks apart. Generally by the end of the story, the couple either dies together or one is left alone in the world to fend off forces that seek vengence of the death of one's lover. In this sense it break from the romantic tradition by not having a HEA type ending, but does not go head long into horror territory.</p>

<p>The idea for the term Esoupe Dii Emiro came from wanting to write about "beutiful death" or the romanticization of couples that are doomed to seperate over a course of severe strain on their relationship. How this will evolve into something seperate from Eru-Guro Nansensu, I'm not quite sure yet.</p>
