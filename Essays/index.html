<h2 id="myunresolvedfeelingsaboutculture">My Unresolved Feelings About Culture</h2>

<p>This will be about my unresolved feelings about French culture. As a background, I had considered myself having certain interests. I suppose you could say fetishes, although that might be to strong of a word. What I will say is despite this fetish, I also paradoxically grew to absolutely disdain French culture, or at least the way that I had perceived it at the time. Now I can’t even talk to a therapist without worrying about cancel culture. I would say my defining Graphic Novel, extremely personal to me, is quite literally me working through my issues about my feelings about French culture on my own.</p>

<p>I don’t even feel comfortable even calling it a Leftist Graphic Novel, although if you asked any people of a certain ilk in comics, anything that is simply about making people’s lives slightly better, is apparently what an SJW is. It was my only chance to actually resolve some personal issues I had with French culture at the time. Because I truly do not expect the left to actually be able to handle such issues in a responsible manner.</p>

<p>It all started when I met this one girl back in fifth grade: apparently the way she would communicate her attraction was by saying shit like “You’re ugly, but French people like ugly people, and I’m French-American.” I suppose it might be more accurate to say that I had issues with French-Americans. Something about moving to the US before the 21st century, and keeping the old values that French had long sense moved past. But around the same time, I was still writing on WTPD where the entire thing of that place was to allow French-Speakers to completely and thoroughly colonize their forums.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, it wasn’t even really possible to even ask for a translation, so I basically had no other choice but to learn French, despite not otherwise having this in mind. This was despite the fact that WTPD was suppose to an English-language forum. If it were the US, this would be one thing, as the US has always been a melting pot. But on a forum where the expectation that you write in English, the French seemed almost the sole exception, until other languages started showing.</p>

<p>So I resisted the idea, as long as I wrote on WTPD, that I would absolutely never learn French. It made me wonder why it was actually that the French had instruments like the guillotine, something that was originally designed as an instrument of mercy, that ended up becoming just another part of colonialism. I imagine people in places attacked by the US, that feel the same way about people that speak the English language. But this graphic novel is based on actual emotional issues that I’ve had. I don’t want the Leftists feeling like they can just push more to be more and more “revolutionary”.</p>

<p>I just want to be decent to other human beings, French or not. Even if I gradually wanted to see that culture bleed. Originally, why I wanted to create this conlang, was not having to worry about constant corrections about my bad ability to speak and write in French. I would much rather just have people not understand what I’m even saying at all, and say what’s on my mind. Seriously, Leftists, you had so much promise. Why are you worshiping the 19th century French?</p>
