<h2 id="myunresolvedfeelingsaboutculture">My Unresolved Feelings About Culture</h2>

<p>This will be about my unresolved feelings about French culture. As a background, I had considered myself having certain interests. I suppose you could say fetishes, although that might be to strong of a word. What I will say is despite this fetish, I also paradoxically grew to absolutely disdain French culture, or at least the way that I had perceived it at the time. Now I can’t even talk to a therapist without worrying about cancel culture. I would say my defining Graphic Novel, extremely personal to me, is quite literally me working through my issues about my feelings about French culture on my own.</p>

<p>I don’t even feel comfortable even calling it a Leftist Graphic Novel, although if you asked any people of a certain ilk in comics, anything that is simply about making people’s lives slightly better, is apparently what an SJW is. It was my only chance to actually resolve some personal issues I had with French culture at the time. Because I truly do not expect the left to actually be able to handle such issues in a responsible manner.</p>

<p>It all started when I met this one girl back in fifth grade: apparently the way she would communicate her attraction was by saying shit like “You’re ugly, but French people like ugly people, and I’m French-American.” I suppose it might be more accurate to say that I had issues with French-Americans. Something about moving to the US before the 21st century, and keeping the old values that French had long sense moved past. But around the same time, I was still writing on WTPD where the entire thing of that place was to allow French-Speakers to completely and thoroughly colonize their forums.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, it wasn’t even really possible to even ask for a translation, so I basically had no other choice but to learn French, despite not otherwise having this in mind. This was despite the fact that WTPD was suppose to an English-language forum. If it were the US, this would be one thing, as the US has always been a melting pot. But on a forum where the expectation that you write in English, the French seemed almost the sole exception, until other languages started showing.</p>

<p>So I resisted the idea, as long as I wrote on WTPD, that I would absolutely never learn French. It made me wonder why it was actually that the French had instruments like the guillotine, something that was originally designed as an instrument of mercy, that ended up becoming just another part of colonialism. I imagine people in places attacked by the US, that feel the same way about people that speak the English language. But this graphic novel is based on actual emotional issues that I’ve had. I don’t want the Leftists feeling like they can just push more to be more and more “revolutionary”.</p>

<p>I just want to be decent to other human beings, French or not. Even if I gradually wanted to see that culture bleed. Originally, why I wanted to create this conlang, was not having to worry about constant corrections about my bad ability to speak and write in French. I would much rather just have people not understand what I’m even saying at all, and say what’s on my mind. Seriously, Leftists, you had so much promise. Why are you worshiping the 19th century French?</p>

  
<h2 id="realismisnoendallbeall">Realism Is No End All Be All</h2>
  
<p>This essay will be about the uncanny valley effect, and why I have never previously liked Western comics in the past. Much this comes from a similar reason why I dislike increasingly realistic 3D modeling in game design, and how it has even ruined JRPGs I otherwise loved: in a sense, unlike Manga, American comics ( and multi-media more generally ) suffers from the uncanny valley effect. One thing slightly off that is unrealistic, and it ruins the entire illusion that American comics has created.</p>

<p>This is why things like Thor smashing things with his hammer, and Superman with his indestructible body and eye lasers I found so jarring: it has established itself to be the “superior” art form, despite the fact that one wrong thing can ruin the image. By contrast, Manga focuses so much on expressiveness and less on realism, that it doesn’t suffer this problem: because they never pretended to be realistic, there isn’t issues like the eyeballs rolling in the incorrect direction, and other things that ruin the illusion: specifically, that Illusion was never created to begin with.</p>

<p>Even in more realistic Manga, like Ikigami and Eternal Sabbath, there is still enough non realism--the “sketchy” look--that an eyeball slightly misaligned is not going to ruin the entire image. Although these just begin to go into what I consider “uncanny effect” for American comics.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Western Comics are largely to blame for having to much realism on their comics, so that if one thing looks slightly off, then the rest of the image looks like crap. Comic Strips also generally do not suffer from this specific problem.</p>

<p>The final issue that such overdoses on realism tends to cause, is that it creates the wrong general impression what is considered good for “entry” level manga creation, and makes people work to something that is generally impossible for beginning artists. It encourages short cuts in the creation process, like tracing Notre Dame, because they have to reach a certain “realism” quota that is simply unattainable for beginning artists. Even the people I’ve seen touting realism, generally will inconsistently apply this expectation: such as giving a pass to “male created” comics that have been grandfathered into the industry.</p>

<p>Mostly the expectation of “realism” is mainly used to harass women and other minorities creators out of the comic creation business, simply because their artistic standards isn’t necessarily the same as what is established in the Big Two in comics. They are even condescending to people who use water colors and ink washes, despite Sumi Painting being an established art form. There are even genres in fine art that play with “realism” for uncanny effects, such as by route of Magical Realism and Surrealism. There is also Cubism and Expressionism as well.</p>

<p>Realism is only one possible way to draw images, but it is far from the definitive way to draw graphic novels.</p>


<h3 id="whileimnottotallyovermanga">While I'm Not Totally Over Manga</h3>
  
<p>I wouldn’t say I’m completely over manga per say, there is still a lot of good manga that is still coming out. But the analogy I would use is someone who buys you a new meal if someone else steals one of your meals. Sure it’s fantastic you get to eat, but what you really want is that other person to stop stealing your food, so your friend doesn’t have to keep buying you new food. In a way, I’ve begun to see manga as that kind soul that keeps buying you new food, but doesn’t really stop the other person from stealing your food. In a sense, whatever way that Manga is counter-cultural, it doesn’t really fix the issues that are present in American comics.</p>

<p>At most what you might be able to say, is Manga distracts you from the issues that are apparent in American comics. But we still have a generation of people that prefers this distraction, rather than fixing the problems that attracted people like US to manga to begin with: it was a break from the environment of being talked down to as children, even though content was supposedly adult fiction. Things would be cut to off screen, despite the target audience being over the age of eighteen. I feel like Manga distracts from the issue. But there are aspects of manga ( particularly Seinin and Josie ) that I prefer over American comics here. But to me the problem isn’t necessarily to keep sending more manga, but to offer what is good about Manga in American comix: it’s able to address social issues in a way that doesn’t just further cement power in the establishment.</p>

<p>Gives American comics the tools to actually be relevant as a an additional “common language”. As it is, American comics are so stuck in the tradition of that particular industry, that they are rapidly losing relevance to people that prefer better comics that manga seems to provide: they prefer people keep buying them new sandwiches, rather than ask the person to stop stealing their food. I feel like Manga has contributed to this environment where Americans cannot even be satisfied with aspects that make American comics unique, or maintain the toxic things of the past that aren’t so much unique as annoying and unnecessary. Or excessively frivolous like super hero content. Manga took advantage of American consumers getting tired of the shit they were being offered in the US, rather than encouraging us to produce equally good content.</p>

<p>This especially effected a certain generation of consumers, between the years 2004-2007, where now books feel genuinely weird because they read left to right: in a sense we prefer reading in the direction of our economic colonizers. The Manga colonization of American comics is almost complete. What I somewhat wish is that rather than manga continuously waving false promises about Manga being a universal language, to actually help Americans produce good content here. Or at least, help Americans integrate into Japan, for those of us who don’t even relate to our own country anymore, do to the political issues that are going on here among extreme factions.</p>

<p>Manga should encourage American comic companies to stop stealing the limelight from Americans that want to actually produce something unique, that has as much relevance in American society, as Alternative Manga does in Japan, and how it came to influence and change the Manga industry. Also none of this American first sentiment, where Americans are saying Japanese people wont read our stuff. I want Japanese people to be proud to read unique American content, as a separate thing from manga. And treated as an equal contender in the marketplace of ideas, rather than relegated as second class citizens. Rather than Manga, Comics itself should be a universal language.</p>

<p>Because all sequential art is comics / manga.</p>
